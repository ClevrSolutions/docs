### New Features

#### Version Control: Size Pre-Check of the MPR File

We introduced a new step during a commit process that checks for a large MPR file. We want users to be informed about large MPR files as can it become problematic for git.

#### Version Control and Storage Format

With Studio Pro 10.18, we are releasing a public beta of [MPRv2 format](/refguide/version-control/#mpr-format), a new storage format for Mendix apps that ensures a good performance over time.

Version Control systems, like Git, store changes in your files with each commit. An app modeled in Mendix is traditionally stored in a single *.mpr* file, which is essentially a database that contains data for all documents, such as microflows, workflows, pages. Git is not well-equipped to determine and store the differences in this case, which leads to rapid repository growth. This in turn can lead to longer download times when cloning your app.

With MPRv2 the key difference is that all documents, such as microflows, will no longer be stored as part of the *.mpr* file but as separate files in the *mprcontents* directory. The *.mpr* file will function as an index file pointing to all the different files on disk. This means that when you change one document, for example, a page, that only a small file representing that page will change on disk. This allows Git to calculate an efficient delta, which results in a more appropriate repository growth compared to MPRv1.

Upgrading to the new format is optional and can be done per branch.
#### Security Overview (Beta)

We are introducing a new beta feature that provides an overview of your app’s security. You can now get an overview of access rules across your application, making it easier to review and ensure the correct security setup for user roles in each module. Access this overview from the **App** menu by selecting **Show Security Overview**. Currently, this feature supports entity access rules, and we will extend support to page, microflow, and nanoflow access rules soon. For more information, see [Security Overview](/refguide/security-overview/).

#### Other New Features


- We introduced the recommender to the page editor, which allows users to easily add new widgets to a page without having to lose context of what they are currently working on. {TW}
- The React client is now generally available.
- We added Maia Learn, a way for new developers to get quickly up to speed with Mendix core concepts. It is available through the toggle button in Maia Chat.
- We added a welcome page to Studio Pro that opens on every new version installed. It contains links to the release notes, Mendix platform blog, links within Studio Pro to Maia Learn and Maia Chat. {TW}
- We added the ability to view file changes and resolve conflicts directly from the **Changes** pane in Studio Pro. You can now open the file comparison tool to review modified files or navigate to the folder containing any changed file listed in the **Changes** pane. To resolve conflicts, simply choose to keep your local version or accept the incoming server version. This update streamlines the management of both project and disk files. For more information, see the [Status](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/#status) section in *Using Version Control in Studio Pro*.
- We added a new option: **Generate Bill of Materials** that is now available under **App** > **Tools**. {TW}
- We added the ability to export the translatable text in your app and re-import it using `mx.exe`. Use `mx.exe translate --help` for an overview of the command line options. For more information, see the [mx translate Command](/refguide/mx-command-line-tool/app/#translate) section in *App Commands*.
- We added consistency checks for custom *index.html* files to inform developers in case they accidentally hard-code templated values.

### Improvements


- We introduced [Maia Domain Model Generator](/refguide/domain-model-generator/), a way to generate Domain models using natural language, enabled by default while it was previously hidden behind a **New Features** setting. It is still, however, in experimental phase. {TW}
- We added a new setting called [Editor Tabs Closing Policy](/refguide/preferences-dialog/#closing-policy) that allows to limit the amount of concurrent working area tabs. 
- We added various UI improvements to Consumed REST service for better user experience.
- We added progress indicator while sending a request in Consumed REST service document.
- We added progress indicator while validating JSON body in Consumed REST service document.
- It is now possible to rename, delete, and duplicate a request in the Consumed REST Service editor by clicking the button with three dots next to the request name.
- We switched to Hermes as the default JavaScript engine for all native mobile applications. This change enhances performance, reduces memory usage, and speeds up start times for mobile apps, leading to a smoother user experience.
- We added a logger which logs to a console in JSON format.
- We added the `WebSocketEndpointConfiguration` interface. An implementation of this interface can be passed to the `Core.addWebSocketEndpoint` method to configure subprotocols and modify the handshake for web sockets. Modifying the handshake can be used to update response headers. {TW}
- We implemented a new method in public API to access database settings: com.mendix.core.conf.Configuration#getDatabaseSettingAsString. {TW}
- We deprecated `getClonedContext` methods in `CoreActionHandler` and `InternalCoreAction`.
- We deprecated `Boolean isValid(IContext context, String identifier)` method in `com.mendix.core.objectmanagement.member.MendixEnum` and provide an alternative version that does not require `IContext` parameter.
- We now use the `ApplicationRootUrl` setting to determine if application cookies should be marked as `Secure`. Previously, we were only checking `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Scheme` headers.

### Fixes

- We fixed an issue where cyclic snippet calls would cause a crash in Studio Pro when Strict Mode was enabled.
- Fixed an issue where pasting widgets from one document template to another would throw an error.
- We fixed an issue where projects sometimes could not be opened after a merge conflict was resolved (ticket 233793).

- We fixed an issue in the error check that could lead to crash when a document was changed again after an earlier change introduced errors because selected elements could not be found.
- We fixed Studio Pro freezes that might happen when editing pages.
- In the Message Definitions editor we now warn the user to refresh when the previously configured structure no longer matches the selected entity.
- We fixed the sync issue between Consumed REST service editor and domain model, now Consumed REST service document need not be reopened to reflect changes in domain model.
- Now the correct request will be visible in the Consumed REST Service editor when you open the editor starting from a request error or warning, or when you press 'Show' from a 'Send REST Request' microflow activity.
- We fixed an issue in consumed OData services where using large metadata files could cause an exception when finding associations (called 'partners' in OData).
- In the logic editors, we fixed an issue when extracting a submicroflow with annotations that are not in the same looped activity as the other objects (Ticket #207767)
- In the logic editors, extracting a microflow doesn't create parameters for variables that are created inside the new microflow (Ticket #226919)
- In the logic editors, we fixed panning the canvas with middle mouse button when the mouse if over connection points, error handler icons, resize handles, and bézier curve handles. (Ticket #224031)
- In the logic editors, we fixed the displayed output variable type for retrieve actions when following a self-association (Ticket #227953)
- In the logic editors, we fixed the generated return values when extracting submicroflows (Ticket #229998)
- In the logic editors, we no longer open property dialogs when ctrl+Enter, alt+Enter, or shift+Enter are pressed, only Enter without additional keys.
- Fixed several issues in the Offline Profile validations that could cause an Oops dialog to appear
- We fixed an issue where Studio Pro theme files (ie. theme-cache/theme.compiled.css.map) showed up as changed. This situation was caused by incorrect generation of line endings in automatically generated content.
For existing apps that may have mixed line endings, possibly on different branches, the file can show up as changed again to correct the situation for your app on the opened branch.
- We improved the naming of "mine/theirs" in the Changes panel when merging or rebasing, to more clearly describe whether changes are coming in from the Server or have been made Locally. More details can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/merge-algorithm/).
- We fixed the issue when localization errors were reported while running command line tools. (Ticket 230517)
- Fixed an issue in the new entity access rules editor on high DPI screens, where icons sometimes appeared blurry, and content peeked through borders during scrolling.
We fixed an issue where user tasks from excluded workflows would not get properly converted when updating a Mendix app to 10.12

### Deprecations

- We deprecated a few legacy setter methods from the public-api.(`ISession.setTimeZone` and `ISession.setUserAgent`)
- We deprecated a few classes and interfaces in our internal M2EE API library (`com.mendix.m2ee.api.AdminAction`, `com.mendix.m2ee.api.AdminException`, `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IAppContainer`, `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IMxRuntime`). We also deprecated the methods `com.mendix.m2ee.api.IMxRuntimeRequest.getContext` and `com.mendix.core.conf.Configuration.checkConfig`.
- We deprecated `com.mendix.core.actionmanagement.CoreAction` class. Use `com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.UserAction` instead.
- We deprecated `IContext context()` method in `com.mendix.systemwideinterfaces.core.UserAction`. Use `IContext getContext()` instead.
-  We deprecated the method `IMendixObjectMember<?> getMember(IContext context, String memberName)` in IMendixObject interface. Please use `IMendixObjectMember<?> getMember(String memberName)` instead.
- We deprecated `String getUnhashedValue()` method of `MendixHashString`. The method was meant for internal use only.
- We no longer support Gradle versions below 8.5.

### Known Issues

* Line endings in CSS files are not being handled properly, so when using [Revert All Changes](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/) or performing other version-control operations, CSS files appear in the [Changes on Disk](/refguide/version-control-menu/#show-changes) dialog box.
  * Workaround: For details, see [this section](/refguide/troubleshoot-version-control-issues/#css-error) in *Troubleshooting Version Control*.
