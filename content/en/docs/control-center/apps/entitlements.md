## Introduction

The **Entitlements** page is a self-service tool that displays the transactions using cloud tokens. You can use the page to monitor your consumption of cloud tokens.

## What Are Cloud Tokens? {#cloud-tokens}

Cloud tokens function as a virtual currency for you to purchase [cloud resource packs](/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/#resource-pack) on the Mendix Platform. If you want to top up the cloud tokens, you can just purchase standard, premium, or premium plus cloud resource packs. Your purchase will be converted into cloud tokens and you can then spend the cloud tokens on any cloud resource pack available to you.

To use cloud tokens, you need to enable self-service. If you want to enable self-service or have questions about cloud tokens, contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM).

From now on, you can only purchase and provision standard, premium, and premium plus cloud resource packs, not legacy resource packs. The cloud tokens for legacy resource packs that you already purchased will be credited back to your account if you deprovision an environment.
