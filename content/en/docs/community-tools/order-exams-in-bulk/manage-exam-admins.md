## Introduction

Your organization can place bulk orders to purchase Mendix certification exam seats. When Mendix processes the order, an exam admin is designated for each order.

As an exam admin, you can add to, or remove exam admins from, an exam order.

## Prerequisites

To manage exam admins, you must also be an exam admin.
