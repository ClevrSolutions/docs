## Introduction

An organization can place bulk orders to purchase Mendix certification exam seats. When Mendix processes the order, an exam admin is designated per order. As an exam admin, you can add or remove exam admins for an exam order.

## Prerequisites

To manage exam admins, you must be an exam admin.

## Procedure

### Adding an Exam Admin

To add an exam admin, do as follows:

1. In [Mendix Academy](https://academy.mendix.com/), go to the **Access Management** page. You can see a full list of the exam admins.

3. In the **User** field, enter the email addresses of the exam admins who you want to add. If you enter multiple email addresses, separate them by commas.
