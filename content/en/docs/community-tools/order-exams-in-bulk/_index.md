## Introduction

You can place bulk orders to purchase Mendix certification exam seats.

Contact your CSM to get the order form or for more details.

After receiving the order, Mendix processes the order and designates an exam admin for each order. The exam admin is then responsible for overseeing the details of the order and assigning the purchased exam seats to individuals within your organization.
