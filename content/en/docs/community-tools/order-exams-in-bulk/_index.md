## Introduction

In the Mendix Academy there are a number of [certifications](https://academy.mendix.com/link/certifications) you can take to demonstrate your Mendix abilities.

### Booking Yourself a Seat

You can register yourself for the certification exams online by following the **Get Certified** link for each certification.

### Booking for Other People

You can also order exam seats for other people and place bulk orders for multiple Mendix certification exam seats for your organization. In this case, contact your CSM to get the order form or for more details. You can also contact Mendix Academy directly on [academy@mendix.com](mailto:academy@mendix.com).

After receiving the order, Mendix assigns an exam admin to it. The exam admin is then responsible for overseeing the details of the order and allocating the purchased exam seats to individuals within your organization.

Exam admins will need to [sign up for a Mendix account](https://signup.mendix.com/link/signup) if they do not already have a Mendix account.
