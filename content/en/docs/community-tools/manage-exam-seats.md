## Introduction

After an organization places a bulk order for exam seats and the order is processed, the designated exam admin will receive an email and notification to manage the order through Academy. The exam admin can then oversee the details of the order and assign the purchased exam seats to individuals within the organization. People who are assigned exam seats will be granted free access to take the exam.

This how-to describes how you, as an exam admin, can manage exam seats on the [exam administration](https://academy.mendix.com/link/examadmin) page.
