## Resources Overview

From the GenAI Resources portal, you will have an overview of all the resources that you have access to. From this overview you are also able to request a new GenAI Resource.  

There are three different types of resources: 

* **Compute - Text Generation**: Text generation resources are used to create human-like text based on given inputs. This capability is crucial for applications that require natural language generation. 

* **Knowledge Base**: A knowledge base can be used to upload your data which then can be used by a text generation resource. 

* **Compute - Embeddings Generation**: Embeddings generation resources are designed to convert text into vector representations. An embeddings resource is required for uploading data to your Knowledge Base.
