## Introduction

The [File Uploader](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/235351) enables you to upload files or images by dragging and dropping them onto the widget or by using the file selection dialog. It supports multi-file uploading and includes an image-only mode that previews thumbnails of the uploaded images. The module comes with a domain model containing entities and nanoflows required for it to function properly.

## Setup

{{% alert color="info" %}}
In the following sections, the "context entity" refers to the entity of the context object in which the File Uploader widget is placed. This can be either a data view or a page parameter.
{{% /alert %}}

### Simple Setup

For a simple setup, the context entity needs to be a specialization of the **FileUploader.FileUploadContext** entity. This allows you to use the nanoflows and entities provided with the module:
* **In your domain model**: 
    * Set the generalization of the context entity to **FileUploader.FileUploadContext**.
    
* **On your page**: 
    * Place the **FileUploader** widget.
    * Set property Associated files to **FileUploader.UploadedFile** or **FileUploader.UploadedImage**, depending on the upload mode.
    * Set property **Action to create new files** to one of the nanoflows shipped with the module, depending on the upload mode.

Note: Starting with File Uploader v2.0, the widget properties will be set automatically.
{{% /alert %}}

### Advanced Setup

For an advanced setup, where modifying the context entity is not possible, follow these steps:
* **In your domain model**: 
    * Create a new specialized image/file entity by setting its generalization to **System.FileDocument** or **System.Image**, depending on the upload mode.
    * Create a **\*-1** association from this image/file entity to your context entity.

* **In the App explorer / Logic editor**:
    * Copy one of the two Nanoflows (depending on the upload mode) from the module and modify it to use your context entity and the newly created file/image entity.

* **On your page**: 
    * Place the **FileUploader** widget.
    * Set the widget property **Associated files** to the newly created file/image entity.
    * Set the widget property **Action to create new files** to the modified nanoflow.
